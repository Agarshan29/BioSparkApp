This project is a comprehensive React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4 single-page application built as a developer assignment. It features an interactive Ligand Explorer dashboard that uses RDKit.js to perform on-the-fly 2D structure rendering and calculate key molecular descriptors. A second page provides a full-featured 3D Protein Viewer powered by NGL Viewer, complete with multiple visualization modes and interactive controls. The application is fully responsive and includes a persistent, resizable "notes" drawer to showcase robust state management with React hooks. The code is architected with a focus on clean data flow, reusability, and modern best practices to handle complex asynchronous library integrations.
